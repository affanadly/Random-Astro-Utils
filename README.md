* `SkyPlot.ipynb` - Plots object path in sky at a specific location on Earth
* `continuum_combine.py` - Combines continuum images into a pseudo-spectral image.
* `ellipse_fit_unc.ipynb` - Ellipse fitting and error estimation using chi-squared
* `weighted_clip.py` - Performs weighting on continuum images based on sensitivity map, analogous to sampling distributions in MCMC.
